### Branching strategy.
For each repo I will have a main branch, Planning, Development, Testing, Issues and Release branches. Each repositorie will start at the Planning branch where the planning and analysis of the project is done. Afte Planning we will statr development of the project and testing as well, when testing is done the final issues and bug are addreses and fixed, all the branced will be mearges with the Release branch to test everything and to see if it work together and if there are any bugs and the Release branch will merge back with the Main Branch.
### .gitignore
.gitignore files will be used in each project.
These files will tell Github which files and folders to ignore when uploading projects to the repository.
The file .gitignore will be created and all the files that needs to be ignored when uploading projects to the repository will be added to the .gitignore file.

### Storage of credentials and sensitive information.
Information and data will be protected by two step verification, special keys for users and a login system
to only provide access to authorised users.
